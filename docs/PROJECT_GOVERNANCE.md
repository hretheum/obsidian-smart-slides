## üìã **Implementation Scaling Guide**

### **Team Size-Based Governance Implementation**

#### **Phase 1: Small Team (2-4 developers) - MVP Governance**
```typescript
interface MVPGovernance {
  readonly required: {
    roles: ['Tech Lead', 'Product Owner'];
    meetings: 'Bi-weekly reviews instead of weekly';
    decisions: 'Tech Lead authority with Product Owner consultation';
    documentation: 'Essential decision records only';
    riskManagement: 'Quarterly risk reviews instead of bi-monthly';
  };
  readonly optional: {
    committees: 'Deferred until Phase 2';
    formalProcesses: 'Lightweight informal processes';
    compliance: 'Basic security and performance checks';
    stakeholderMgmt: 'Core stakeholders only';
  };
  readonly timeline: {
    decisionResponse: '<12h for routine, <24h for complex';
    emergencyResponse: '<8h for security, <16h for other critical';
    reviewCycles: 'Monthly instead of weekly';
  };
}
```

#### **Phase 2: Growing Team (5-10 developers) - Standard Governance**
```typescript
interface StandardGovernance {
  readonly additional: {
    roles: ['Security Lead', 'Community Representative'];
    meetings: 'Weekly team meetings + bi-weekly steering';
    processes: 'Formal change management and risk assessment';
    documentation: 'Full decision record templates';
  };
  readonly governance: {
    committees: 'Technical Architecture Working Group';
    qualityGates: 'Full implementation of quality gates';
    stakeholders: 'Active stakeholder management';
    compliance: 'Monthly compliance dashboards';
  };
}
```

#### **Phase 3: Mature Team (10+ developers) - Full Governance**
```typescript
interface FullGovernance {
  readonly complete: {
    committees: 'All specialized working groups active';
    processes: 'Complete governance framework implementation';
    automation: 'Automated compliance and monitoring';
    external: 'External stakeholder management';
    timeline: 'Full framework timelines as specified';
  };
}
```

### **Graduation Criteria Between Phases**

#### **MVP ‚Üí Standard Governance**
- Team size reaches 5+ developers
- External stakeholder requirements increase
- Security or compliance requirements mandate formal processes
- Project complexity requires specialized expertise

#### **Standard ‚Üí Full Governance**
- Team size reaches 10+ developers  
- Multiple concurrent workstreams require coordination
- External audit or compliance requirements
- Project becomes mission-critical for organization

## üîß **Plugin-Specific Governance Considerations**

### **Obsidian Ecosystem Compliance**
```typescript
interface PluginGovernanceRequirements {
  readonly pluginStore: {
    requirements: ['Code review for store submission', 'Security audit', 'Compatibility testing'];
    timeline: 'Submit for review 1 week before target release';
    owner: 'Obsidian Liaison (from Steering Committee)';
  };
  readonly communityFeedback: {
    channels: ['GitHub Issues', 'Obsidian Forum', 'Discord Community'];
    responseTime: '<48h for user-reported issues';
    escalation: 'Community Representative handles feedback integration';
  };
  readonly apiCompliance: {
    monitoring: 'Continuous monitoring of Obsidian API changes';
    adaptation: 'Immediate response to breaking changes';
    testing: 'Regression testing with each Obsidian update';
  };
}
```

### **Open Source Governance Elements**
```typescript
interface OpenSourceGovernance {
  readonly contributions: {
    process: 'Defined contribution guidelines and review process';
    licensing: 'Clear license compliance for all contributions';
    attribution: 'Proper contributor recognition and rights management';
  };
  readonly community: {
    codeOfConduct: 'Enforced community standards and behavior guidelines';
    moderation: 'Clear moderation policies and escalation procedures';
    transparency: 'Public roadmap and decision rationale sharing';
  };
}
```
